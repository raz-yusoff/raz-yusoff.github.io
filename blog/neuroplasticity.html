                  <p>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>
                  <p>As it allows nueral networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization, its benefits are many fold, including having significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage. We're not just talking about reorganizing neural networks in a new way but also restore old, 'lost' connections and functions that have not been used in some time, enhance memory, and even enhance overall cognitive skills.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</p>
                  <p>Through a lot of in depth, reflective thinking on top of the physical practice of whatever endeavour I'm pursuing. I think for my own personal case, I need to practice focussing on the topic at hand; my thoughts are too easily distracted and often delve into a rabbit hole of other, though not entirely unrelated, topics. It's the problem of a physicist mindset I'd like to think.</p>
                </li>    
                <li>
                  <p>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
                  <p>I'll first list what I understand of the two oftenly discussed 'types' of nueral plasticity:</p>
                  <p><strong>Structural neuroplasticity</strong>: Structural plasticity is often understood as the brain's ability to change its neuronal connections. New neurons are constantly produced and integrated into the central nervous system throughout the life span based on this type of neuroplasticity. his type of neuroplasticity often studies the effect of various internal or external stimuli on the brain's anatomical reorganization. The changes of grey matter proportion or the synaptic strength in the brain are considered as examples of structural neuroplasticity.</p>
                  <p><strong>Functional neuroplasticity</strong>: Functional plasticity refers to brain's ability to alter and adapt the functional properties of neurons. The changes can occur in response to previous activity (activity-dependent plasticity) to acquire memory or in response to malfunction or damage of neurons (reactive plasticity) to compensate a pathological event. In the latter case the functions from one part of the brain transfer to another part of the brain based on the demand to produce recovery of behavioral or physiological processes. Regarding physiological forms of activity-dependent plasticity, those involving synapses are referred to as synaptic plasticity. The strengthening or weakening of synapses that results in an increase or decrease of firing rate of the neurons are called long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively, and they are considered as examples of synaptic plasticity that are associated with memory. The cerebellum is a typical structure with combinations of LTP/LTD and redundancy within the circuitry, allowing plasticity at several sites. More recently it has become clearer that synaptic plasticity can be complemented by another form of activity-dependent plasticity involving the intrinsic excitability of neurons, which is referred to as intrinsic plasticity. This, as opposed to homeostatic plasticity does not necessarily maintain the overall activity of a neuron within a network but contributes to encoding memories.</p>
                  <p>So from my reading, it appears that I could benefit most from figuring out how to set 'trigger' events that automatically fire a path of neural activity for the things that I would like to learn. I am still pondering how I might do that... perhaps in contextualising every single puzzle I'm solving with something that is potentially really interesting in real life e.g. running 'for' loops to filter through data can be thought of as being conceptually the same as filtering through data on the frequency of a neutron star's pulsation and its red/blue shift away from us to figure out its distance from us.</p>

              <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>	
                  <p>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p>
                  <p>Individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of "where ability comes from". In particular, an individual's mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges. Dr Carol Dweck states that there are two categories (growth mindset versus fixed mindset) that can group individuals based on their behaviour, specifically their reaction to failure.</p>
                  <p>People with a "fixed mindset" believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities.</p>
                  <p>According to Dr Dweck, individuals with a "growth" mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks. Those with a "growth mindset" believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.</p>

                  <p>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
                  <p>I think I've always believed in the importance of nurturing a growth mindset in people, especially in childhood, so without sounding pretentious this section and materials on Growth mindset has not been all too surprising. Perhaps unfortunately that also means not much change, however I can say it's made me reflect more on what I could potentially and realistically achieve in every step and aim for that, i.e. it's reinforced my idea that there's always room for more (personal) growth, just have to stay focussed and keep track of what is immediately achievable and work on that, and step by step (and there may be a few steps back along the way) eventually one can reach their ultimate goals.</p>
                  <p>This material has brought up a question though: it's addressed how individuals could benefit in their own personal circumstances from a growth mindset, but it hasn't addressed its significance in the context of inequity in circumstances in society. That in itself can be a setback even for individuals with a strong growth mindset. Dr Dweck's TED talk mentioned kids in the lower socioeconomic neighbourhoods performing better than the 'Microsoft' kids, but at the end of the day what has been the societal outcome for those kids compared to the 'Microsoft' kids. I ponder there's still that issue in inequity, where you could have a stronger growth mindset AND perform better in tests but still end up worst off. Neural Darwinism would dictate that that would not help the cause to try to nurture a growth mindset in more people.</p>

                  <p>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
                  <p>I remember when learning for my physics degree we spent 99.9% of the time completely in the dark in terms of our understanding of all the big concepts, from simple relativity to complex quantum mechanics. But curiosity fuelled our grit to 'want to' understand more, and that it was completely okay to be clueless. I think I will have to carry that mindset into coding as well and just continue to be curious and wanting to learn more, at least to get an understanding of why the 'machine' interprets code the way it does. It's also helpful I think that I already have future topics of interests lined up after this course that I would like to delve into deeper, including Quantum computing, so that will help to keep the curiosity level up.</p>

              <h4>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>	
                  <p>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</p>
                  <p>It's a fine balance I will have to keep, because a major part of my learning plan and strategy is actually to in a way 'keep my curiosity in check' because I often and very easily lose focus on the material at hand and head off into a rabbit hole of other topics. Whilst the Growth mindset requires that I keep that curiosity level up, to help make it through periods of frustrations for example. I will have to build up on my discipline and organizational skills I guess and look at it this way: I can't and should never curb that curiosity but I will have to convince myself that the current topic is the most interesting topic to focus on.</p>
