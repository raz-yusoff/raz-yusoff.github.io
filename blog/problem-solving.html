              <h4>A time I got stuck on a simple problem</h4>
              <p>
                I didn't really get stuck anywhere, just frustrated at one part because the instructions kinda threw me off lol. In the JS-Olympics repl.it, the instructions for the Bluk Up part asked us to use a for loop, so I used a for loop and it worked. But then at the end of the whole challenge I looked at the sample solution for referrence and noticed they used a forEach loop! I would have considered using a forEach loop if that hadn't thrown me off like that. But not really that angry about it. Ah well as long as it works and I'm learning.
              </p>
              <h4>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h4>
              <p>
                In the fizzBuzz challenge I completely forgot about the remainder operator (%) and used a sequence of for loops and if loops. It works and I guess I pretty much hard corded the remainder operator with my loops. When I refered to the sample solutions afterwards and noticed they just used the % operator, I stuck to my guns and declared that my solution is pretty elegant, in the sense that imagine if I was dealing with a programming language that didn't have the remainder operator but had the usual for iteration loops and if/else statement functionality, means that I would still be able to do the fizzBuzz challenge lol.
              </p>
              <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pseudocode</strong>: very happy with learning this method. It has helped me tremendously and if you look at my repl.it excercises I use this method quite a bit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trying something</strong>: no choice because the nature of coding is such that if something doesn't work you must be prepared to check out another method. And I am open to this technique.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>: I do talk to myself quite a bit whilst building each line of code, so without knowing it I may have actually been doing this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reading error messages</strong>: very confident. It's pretty much the only way to see where exactly in your code there's a bug or error. Imagine trying to debug without error messages! 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Console.logging</strong>: use it religiously. Looking at my repl.it code I almost console.log after every step just to be sure I'm 'outputting' what I intended to be outputting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Googling</strong>: saved my life. I can't possibly remember all the syntax so quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>: Ahhhh, I could do better in this regard. I'm usually quite a sociable person so am quite surprised to find that I've been very quiet and shy so far throughout foundations, preferring to just be a spectator in everyone's messages on slack. I do have to chip in a bit more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>: I will! Saving these for the bootcamp!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>: I am usually naturally quite reflective, but this course has made me reflect on the most effective way to reflect, so to speak. I.e. focus on reflecting on the subject matter at hand - I'm a trained physicist and naturally tend to fall into a rabbit hole of random, though not completely unrelated, thoughts and reflections. For example, the other day in the middle of challenge I got sidetracked and started researching quantum computing for two hours!
