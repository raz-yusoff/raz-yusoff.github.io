                    I kinda giggled to myself when I noticed that they mentioned Daniel Goleman in the Emotional Intelligence section of Sprint 3. Rightly they described him as one of the fathers of Emotional Intelligence research. He worked close with Gallup research, who around 12 years ago started doing the biggest global studies on Emotional Intelligence, particularly as it pertains to employee engangement. Following the start of Gallup's research, in around 2012, the public world started to really take notice of the topic of Emotional Intelligence.

                <p>
                    From 2011 to 2012 I worked for Gallup as the Field Supervisor (akin to an operations supervisor) in the research department. At the time it just felt like interesting research - we ran a study that assessed hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, under the Gallup World Poll study (a section of which is to do with Emotional Intelligence and Employee engagement). I didn't quite realize it was going to be such a major referenced work gloablly - every organization I've worked with since have referenced Gallup's data. Even at Dev Academy, when I saw the name Daniel Goleman mentioned, I couldn't help but chuckle a little. When I was working for Gallup they also had two Nobel prize winning social scientists (Economics) working for them and churning out amazing research; check out Gallup senior scientists <a href="https://www.gallup.com/seniorscientists/177215/angus-deaton.aspx" target="blank">Dr Angus Deaton's</a> and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/14872/happy-now.aspx" target="blank">Dr Daniel Kahneman's</a> profiles on the gallup website. Both scientists lead research on wellbeing and human capital.

                <p>The life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings that have always sparked widespread interest. Readers may be drawn in by wanting to know how their nation is faring but soon become curious about the secrets of life in the happiest countries. The Gallup team has always been extraordinarily helpful and efficient in getting each year's data available in time for our annual launches on International Day of Happiness, March 20th. Right from the outset, we received very favourable terms from Gallup and the very best of treatment. Gallup researchers have also contributed to the content of several World Happiness Reports. The value of this partnership was recognized by two Betterment of the Human Conditions Awards from the International Society for Quality of Life Studies. The first was in 2014 for the World Happiness Report, and the second, in 2017, went to the Gallup Organization for the Gallup World Poll."</p>

                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>The ability to recognize the context behind the emotions that people have. Every emotion is a response to an instance, whether positive or negative, but it's usually to do with our background that determines which of those emotions are displayed when something happens. So we need to be able to comprehend those backgrounds/context to see that pretty much any emotion can be explained to be rational. In other words, people are allowed to feel the way they feel.

                Raz's Ethos of the Chill
                <br>    
                <br>    
                Chill people are happy with letting you talk about whatever you wanna talk about :)
                And the chillest of the chilled will always engage with and add to whatever you're talking about, they're always encouraging...
                Because the Ethos of the Chill is to recognize that people are allowed to feel the way they're feeling.
                </p>

                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p>The difference can be seen in describing how they are similar. IQ is the capacity to see patterns in information and data, and be able to use that capacity to be able to predict future behaviours in terms of outcomes when a new situation arises. EQ is the is the capacity to see patterns in people's reactions/emotions, to relate that to the context/background of why those emotions occur, and then be able to use that capacity to predict or anticipate future reactions/emotions when a new situation arises, hopefully in a benign way.</p>

                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>To be able to deliver optimally as a group, whatever it is the goals that were set, whether they were professional goals or personal ones.</p>
