                    I kinda giggled to myself when I noticed that they mentioned Daniel Goleman in the Emotional Intelligence section of Sprint 3. Rightly they described him as one of the fathers of Emotional Intelligence research. He worked closely with the Gallup organization's data, who around 12 years ago started doing the largest global study on Emotional Intelligence, particularly as it pertained to employee engangement. Following the first publications of Gallup's research, in around 2012, the public world started to really take notice of the topic of Emotional Intelligence.

                <p>
                    From 2011 to 2012 I worked for Gallup as the Field Supervisor (akin to an operations supervisor) in the research department. At the time it just felt like interesting research work - we ran a study that assessed hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, under the Gallup World Poll study (a section of which is to do with Emotional Intelligence and Employee engagement). I didn't quite realize it was going to be such a major referenced work globally, but every organization I've worked with since have referenced Gallup's data. Even at Dev Academy when I saw the name Daniel Goleman mentioned, I couldn't help but chuckle a little. When I was working for Gallup they also had two Nobel prize winning social scientists working for them and churning out amazing research - check out Gallup senior scientists <a href="https://www.gallup.com/seniorscientists/177215/angus-deaton.aspx" target="blank">Dr Angus Deaton's</a> and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/14872/happy-now.aspx" target="blank">Dr Daniel Kahneman's</a> profiles on the Gallup website. Both scientists lead research on wellbeing and human capital.

The Gallup team has always been extraordinarily helpful and efficient in getting each year's data available in time for our annual launches on International Day of Happiness, March 20th. Right from the outset, we received very favourable terms from Gallup and the very best of treatment. Gallup researchers have also contributed to the content of several World Happiness Reports. The value of this partnership was recognized by two Betterment of the Human Conditions Awards from the International Society for Quality of Life Studies. The first was in 2014 for the World Happiness Report, and the second, in 2017, went to the Gallup Organization for the Gallup World Poll."</p>

                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>At present, there is no actual consensus on the definition of EI, even amongst its 'modern' founding members Stanley Greenspan, Peter Savoy, John Mayer and Daniel Goleman. However it was Goleman who made the term widely known upon the publication of his book <em>Emotional Intelligence - Why it can matter more than IQ (1995)</em>. As mentioned in the above sections, Goleman also referenced huge field based studies (particularly Gallup's research on effective managers and engaged employees) in his own analysis/treatment of the matter.</p>
                <p>Substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Ability model</li>
                  <li>Mixed model (usually subsumed under trait EI)</li>
                  <li>Trait model</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Ability Model</strong>
                <p>Salovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence. Their definition of EI evolved into "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth."</p>
                <p>The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Perceiving emotions</strong> - the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts-including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.</li>
                  <li><strong>Using emotions</strong> - the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem-solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing moods in order to best fit the task at hand.</li>
                  <li><strong>Understanding emotions</strong> - the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Managing emotions</strong> - the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Mixed Model</strong>
                <p>Daniel Goleman focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> - the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values and goals and recognize their impact on others while using gut feelings to guide decisions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> - involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.</li>
                  <li><strong>Social skill</strong> - managing relationships to get along with others.</li>
                  <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Motivation</strong> - being aware of what motivates them.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Trait model</strong>
                <p>Konstantinos V. Petrides proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a trait based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications. Trait EI is "a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality." In other words, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by self report, as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a personality framework. An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional self-efficacy.</p>
                <p>The trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the taxonomy of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.</p>
                <strong>Raz's take on all the different definitions as an ex-social scientist working for the Gallup Organization</strong>
                <p>I guess at the end of the day what can be measured and matters is <em>outcomes</em> - how productive a group is? In a nutshell, the 'challenge' that EI seeks to address is diversity, because in a uniform world there wouldn't need to be any EI as everyone should already be thinking the same way (thankfully a 100% uniform world is an impossibility). So ask: how diverse is a group/community/society, both in identity and in their ideals, and how effective are they at being productive in spite of and/or aided by that diversity.</p>
                <p>I come from Singapore. If you look up any objective measurements on human capital (housing, education, healthcare, safety from crime etc.), they top the rankings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Capital_Index" target="blank">World Bank Human Capital Index</a>). Human capital is the social science term for "wellbeing" - if you refer to NZ's <a href="https://www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2021/bps/wellbeing-outlook-human-capital.htm" target="blank">Wellbeing Budget</a>, you'll see that the official measurements they use are human capital factors. Nobel prize winning scientist Paul Romer gave an <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/meet-the-winners-of-this-years-nobel-prize-for-economics/" target="blank">interview</a> on human capital/wellbeing at the World Economic Forum(WEF) in 2018, and in the following year's WEF, not coincidentally, PM Jacinda Ardern spoke on the 'More than GDP' panel and talked about restructuring economic growth to revolve around human wellbeing instead of purely GDP (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqzlFffL0W4" target="blank">the video went viral and is known as her 'kindness' speech)</a>. Paul Romer was the Chief Economist at the World Bank, whose Human Capital Index Singapore tops.

                <p>How does this pertain to diversity? If you look up "the most religiously diverse country in the world" and "country with the highest IQ", you'll find that Singapore tops those lists too. And 'despite' the diveristy, it's undeniable that they have one of, if not the, most productive economies in the world. Unfortunately people are often stuck on thinking that it's 'draconian'. But consider this: the total number of people serving a sentence or bail order in NZ is 37,771; that total is 12,668 in Singapore. Singapore also has fewer police officers per 100 residents than NZ. So there's a lot more to it than just our chewing gum laws would suggest. Also importantly, consistent with international <a href="https://dataunodc.un.org/" target="blank">crime rate data</a>, Gallup's Global Law & Order index did a global study of some 170,000 people and Singapore came out on top for the place that people feel the safest walking alone at night. Freedom is about having choices, and in Singapore people have a lot more opportunities and choices in life in general - apart from wanting to be a drug trafficker, violent criminal or chewing gum wholesaler, what can't you really do there. Not to mention that home ownership rate in Singapore is at 94%; even amongst the lowest 20% of socioeconomic households - i.e. the 'poorest' 20% - the home ownership rate is 87%.</p>

                <p>The OECD PISA conducted the largest study of its kind on <a href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/innovation/global-competence/" target="blank">Global Competence</a>, where some 600,000 were assessed. Global Competence is defined as: <em>"the skills, values, and behaviours that prepare people to thrive in a more diverse, interconnected world"</em>. Singapore topped that ranking as well. Here's the NZ Ministry of Education's <a href="https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/schooling2/large-scale-international-assessments/pisa-2018-global-competence-of-new-zealand-15-year-olds" target="blank">review</a> of the OECD PISA Global Competence study.


                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p>The difference can be seen in describing how they are similar. IQ is the capacity to see patterns in information and data, and be able to use that capacity to be able to predict future behaviours in terms of outcomes when a new situation arises. EQ is the is the capacity to see patterns in people's reactions/emotions, to relate that to the context/background of why those emotions occur, and then be able to use that capacity to predict or anticipate future reactions/emotions when a new situation arises, hopefully in a benign way.</p>

                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>To be able to deliver optimally as a group, whatever the goals, whether they were professional goals or personal ones.</p>
