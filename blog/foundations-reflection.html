            <div class="col-xs-12">
              <ul>
                <li>	
                  <p>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>
                  <p>1)	I am confident of my abilities but I can feel demotivated at times when I feel like the opportunities may not be there to really use this growth or abilities to personally thrive and also contribute in a meaningful way. But then again, I'm from Singapore where even amongst the lowest 20% of socioeconomic households the home ownership rate is still 87%, and where the indigenous minority, of which I am a part, have scored better in PISA than the OECD average (that's the average for developed economies!).</p>
                  <p>2)	I completely agree with the human skills covered in the Core competencies and I have always felt that they are important, but unfortunately what I learnt about myself as I read through more and more of the Core material was that I do have to remember to take care of my own wellbeing as well. It may be a little sceptical to say, but in a society where you gotta be a little crazy to be human and where one-upmanship really has its benefits to individuals, while whole communities are being left behind, you do have to take care of your own wellbeing. It's all about context.</p>
                  <p>3)	And that despite the above trepidations, I am still quite focussed and disciplined enough to get through the materials, which is quite reassuring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>	
                  <p>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
                  <p>In a nutshell, no person is an island. The world is getting more and more interconnected, diverse (not just culturally, but in ideas, character and personality as well) and the bias' of the past are no longer paying off. So it's really important that one is able to work in a more diverse environment (empathy), still be able to remain mentally healthy (self awareness) whilst not forgoing on some key human values.</p>
                </li>
                <li>	
                  <p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
                  <p>It's really made me think about each of the aspects they cover. I used to work as a social data scientist for Gallup, which ran the biggest studies on such topics (even some of the Core materials referenced in this course came from studies conducted by Gallup); so there concepts have always been very important to me. But these sections have made me even more reflective of them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>	
                  <p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
                  <p>Fighting any feeling of demotivation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>	
                  <p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
                  <p>I have been criticized recently for speculating or inferring. To be honest I just want to use this opportunity to build up on my Core skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li>	
                  <p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
                  <p>Not at all. It is so very important. Again I don't want to be speculating or inferring, so just suffice to say that I believe it's very important.</p>
