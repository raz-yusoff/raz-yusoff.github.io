        <p class="col-xs-12">Globetrotting international upbringing - I attended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/dec/12/publicschools.schools">international schools</a>; multicultural mixed household; multi-lingual; Singaporean (the most religiously diverse yet innovative country in the world).</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12">
              <p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
              <ul>    
                  <li>Went over a supervisor's monitoring eye and allowed a lady offender on GPS to leave the address to pick up their kid from a football game. Looked at her risk profile and spoke to her, making clear the instructions and consequences of any non-compliance. Consequences of my action were that my supervisor wasn't too happy about it, there was a bit of tension while she was out and I was monitoring her movements, hoping that she didn't deviate from the instructions. But it all worked out.</li>            
              </ul>
              
              <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</p>
              <ul><li>I  come from one of the most ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse country in the world. It is the most religiously diverse and yet highly productive and innovative. Excellent housing, education, healthcare outcomes and low crime. I also grew up attending international schools in multiple countries and within a multicultural, multi-ethnic household, so I guess my culture is best described as 'Cosmopolitan'? My values is diverse (unity and not uniformity), and my identity is one and everything (mosaic and not a melting pot). More like a chameleon rather than someone who is half/half.</li></ul>

          <h3 class="col-xs-12 text-uppercase">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations</h3>
          <div class="col-xs-12">
              <p>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
              <ul><li>Strengths are empathy, being able to see multiple perspective borne from necessity really (can't grow up comfortably in very international settings if you can't do that). It leads into adaptability and subsequently being strategic, cos otherwise you're just wasting time if you’re not taking account of the circumstances of the situation in the first place and you just try to solve problems by sticking square pegs in round holes.</li></ul>
              <p>Limitations are (also from Strengthsfinder)</p>
              <ul><li>I'll struggle to communicate this, regardless of how articulate I am because: to understand is within one's means; to be understood is beyond one's control. So this will have to be taken into account and adapted to. I do best in international, diverse settings.</li></ul>
              <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</p>
              <ul><li>Empathy leads to adaptability followed by being effectively strategic, because the former two strengths ensure that I'm staying realistic to the circumstances at hand to begin with. The ideation and activator part will be useful because there's no point being able to empathies, adapt and strategise if you then don't have the ideas or creativity for a project, and the activator spirit to get a group going.</li></ul>
              <p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
              <ul><li>Plenty of times with various government departments. They are too rigid and not diverse enough to be able to learn from different systems. Coming from my cultural background, often the first challenge is to justify that you’re not speaking from an irrational place without any data or logic to back you up. The problem is when people have the tendency to view themselves as 'logical' when all they're doing is limiting their understanding of life to the simplest logics, while crazily at the same time acknowledging that the world doesn't seem to be adhering to those logics. Life is a complex web of micro-logics and if you're the type who thinks that the world can be explained by simple blocky chuncks of logic, chances are you're way off. I find that people and countries with a more international, diverse background tend to be able to understand this better and use it to their advantage.</li></ul>
