                <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
                <p>I was thinking of working in the tech field, possibly on the venture capitalism side of things. Side projects would be looking into the burgeoning field of Quantum Computing.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
                <p>Strengths: problem solving in a group<br>
                  Limitations: Dealing with difficult people, but then again I do have a lot of experience with that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
                <p>Honestly, in our society in general there are too many one-upmanship type characters, which just makes it all less fun. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses and the most optimal group is that one that can leverage on all the different strengths, but the pervasive one-upmanship mentality do often get in the way.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
                <p>How to gain the trust of others without compromising on any of my values. I'm from Singapore and the common narrative is that we are a draconian society, despite actually having far fewer people serving a sentence or bail order; a far higher successful rehab rate; fewer police shooting people and people shooting police incidents; fewer homeless people; higher home-ownership rates; better access to education and other resources amongst the lower socioeconomic households; much lower crime rate etc. Often people are caught up on our chewing gum laws though, even though there's more life than that. I've had to compromise on my values quite a bit just to be able to have a word in.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
                <p>I'm actually very happy with the support from the facilitators thus far! To be available for technical and human support really.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
                <p>Learn and practice a lot of useful tech and human skills.</p>

                <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
                To pick up futureproof skills, starting with Web Development, and specialize in an area that I will find particularly interesting. At the moment I've been researching quantum computing. Career pathway: be able to participate in productive, meaningful work whilst having the flexibility to work remotely.

                <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
                </h4>
                I am naturally very inquisitive and reflective but not very focused. Ironically in the inquisitiveness that causes me to drift away often in my thoughts and get caught up researching and reading up on other topics whilst I still have a distinct learning 'curriculum' to get through. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                </h4>
                To be able to communicate my ideas more clearly and not just be content with being the learner all the time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                </h4>
                <p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                </p>
                <ul><li>	
                    There's always something interesting to learn from somebody. No two people have exactly 100% the same life experiences. Plus you serve to strengthen yourself in learning from others.
                </li></ul>
                <p>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
                </p>
                <ul><li>
                    Take frequent breaks away from the screen and play guitar (but mindful not to get too distracted away from the course work).
                </li></ul>
                <br>
                <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                </h4>	
                Unashamedly seek help from the nearest (i.e. easily accessible), available person.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
                </h4>
                They needn't be able to answer or help solve every technical question, but to be available at a human capacity to help me stay focus and on course. Especially utilizing any anecdotal experiences they have that may be relevant to whatever situations I come across. A possible analogy might be: the interactions between a coach or sports team manager and their player(s) - the coach/manager is not necessarily better than the player technically but is there to monitor progress through the training (in this case the curriculum) and give timely pieces of advice to encourage staying focused and on course.

                </h4>Half a dozen mini 15 minute breaks each day to meditate and reset.
